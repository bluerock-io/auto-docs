## Showcase your Development

**Thanks for helping make the world more correct!**

Maybe you verified just the piece of code that someone else is looking for, or maybe you found some new patterns that ease specification or verification.
In either case (and more!) we (and the rest of the community) would really like to know about it.
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/bluerock-io/auto-docs/issues) on this repository and we'll link it here.

Can't share the code? No problem, we're happy to link to information about projects that are not open source.
